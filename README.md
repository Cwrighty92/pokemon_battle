# Pokemon_Battle_Console_Game
  
  Pokemon Battle terminal Game, fight against a Rare powerful Pokemon with a group of selected available pokemon.
  
  This was a early project I worked on when first learning to code, I'm readding it to my git repos now so I don't lose it, It   needs some refactoring and some more testing adding however plays quite nicely at the moment.
  
# Current features: 

   1. The ability to randomly critical hit
   2. Weaknesses and Strengths included in damage calculation
   3. Ability to build a team of pokemon by selecting from array of pokemon
   4. Opponent pokemon has fav move to use
   5. Random evolution chance mid battle for Magikarp (not so uselss afterall)
   6. Some unique moves for pokemon like Snorlax rest and Tangala absorb providing healing.
  
# Future Ideas:
  
  1. Add the ability to battle wild pokemon instead as an introduction and the ability to catch them in order to progress
  2. Convert the game into a UI triggered game rather than a console only game
  3. Have the opponent pokemon have decision based ability usage
  4. Implement Items to use on pokemon
  5. Add pokemon stats rather than damage to recalcuate damage inflicted and taken
