# Pokemon_Battle_Console_Game
  
  Pokemon Battle terminal Game, fight against a Rare powerful Pokemon with a group of selected available pokemon.
  
  This was a early project I worked on when first learning to code, I'm readding it to my git repos now so I don't lose it, It   needs some refactoring and some more testing adding however plays quite nicely at the moment.
  
# Future Ideas:
  
  1. Add the ability to battle wild pokemon instead as an introduction and the ability to catch them in order to progress
  2. Convert the game into a UI triggered game rather than a console only game.

# To run game

  2. Npm install
  3. Npm run play

# Built using
